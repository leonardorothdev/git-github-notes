## GitHub - My Notes from Alura Course

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is an online platform for storing, managing, and sharing project source code. It uses Git, a version control system that helps track changes made to the code over time. This is extremely useful for programmers, as it allows them to:

- Collaborate on projects with others, even in large teams.
- Control versions of the code, making it easier to revert to previous versions if something goes wrong.
- Document projects and share them with the community.
- Automate processes, such as tests and deployments, using integrated tools.

### What is a GitHub Repository?

A repository on GitHub is essentially a “folder” where all the code, files, and history of a project are stored. It contains everything needed for someone to understand, run, and contribute to the project.

### What's in a repository?

- **Source code**: The project files, such as `.js` in the case of JavaScript.
- **README.md**: An initial documentation file that explains the purpose of the project, how to run it, and other important information.
- **Commit history**: Records of changes made over time.
- **Issues**: A space to report bugs, suggest improvements, or discuss ideas.
- **Branches**: Parallel lines of development (such as the `main` branch and others for new features).

### Why are repositories important?

- They help you organize projects and keep track of changes.
- They are essential for team collaboration.
- On GitHub, they function as a portfolio to showcase your skills.
