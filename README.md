# Git and GitHub Notes

This repository is a personal learning project where I am practicing Git and GitHub commands. The purpose of this repository is to document and experiment with essential version control techniques used in software development.

## What I'm Learning

- How to initialize a Git repository (`git init`).
- Basic Git commands like `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`.
- Working with branches (`git branch`, `git checkout`, `git merge`).
- Connecting a local repository to a remote repository on GitHub.
- Resolving merge conflicts.
- Using GitHub for collaboration and version control in projects.

## Why This Repository Exists

This repository serves as a playground to try out different Git features and workflows. By documenting my progress, I aim to reinforce my understanding of version control systems and improve my skills in using Git for professional development.

It will also be a resource where I can refer back to examples and commands I have learned, making it easier to apply these techniques in future projects.
