## Git - Introduction and Concept

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system used to track changes in files and coordinate work among multiple people on software projects. It is essential in modern software development because it helps manage a project's history, making collaborative and secure work easier.

##  Why is Git important?

- Change tracking: Every change in the code is recorded, allowing you to revert to previous versions if something goes wrong.
- Teamwork: Multiple developers can work on the same project without overwriting each other's work.
- Distributed control: Each person has a complete copy of the repository, including the entire history, providing security and flexibility.
- Efficient workflows: Enables the creation of branches to develop separate features without affecting the main code.

## How does Git work at a high level?

- Repository (repo): The place where the project and its change history are stored.
- Commit: A record of a change in the code. Each commit includes a descriptive message.
- Branch: A branch of the main project where you can work on new features in isolation.
- Merge: Combines changes from one branch into another (usually the main branch, main).
- Clone and Push:
    - Clone: Copies a remote repository to your local machine.
    - Push: Sends your local changes to the remote repository (such as GitHub).
